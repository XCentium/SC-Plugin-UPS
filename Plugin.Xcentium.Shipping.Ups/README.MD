Note:
=====
- Each physical product that will be shipped to buyers should have dimensions and weight.

- Set a desired value for "CompensationMultipier" default is 1 this is the value of the multiple of the cart total that will be paid by UPS if the package were to be damaged or lost in transit. Value of 1 means 100% compensation. Value of 2 means the compensation will be twice the original amount paid by the customer
